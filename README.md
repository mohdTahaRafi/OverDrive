Project Concept: DevVibe Dashboard
Idea Overview:
Create a web-based dashboard designed for developers that consolidates both professional and leisure information in one place. The dashboard will provide:

Competitive Programming Insights:
Display real‑time contest stats, rating changes, and problem-solving history from Codeforces API.

Developer Profile Overview:
Show GitHub profile stats (repositories, followers, contributions, etc.) via GitHub API.

Current Weather & Local Updates:
Display localized weather data from Open Weather API.

Tech & Entertainment News:
Present the latest headlines from News API and suggest developer‑friendly movie recommendations from the Movie API.

Custom Motivational Booster (Bonus):
Develop your own lightweight npm package (e.g., dev-motivator) that generates daily motivational quotes for developers. This not only demonstrates your ability to build custom APIs/npm packages but also earns bonus points.

API Integration (Minimum 5 APIs)
Codeforces API

Usage: Fetch contest data, problem statistics, and rating changes.

Difficulty: Easy (1 point)

GitHub API

Usage: Retrieve public profile data, repository counts, and contribution graphs.

Difficulty: Easy (1 point)

Open Weather API

Usage: Get current weather and forecast data based on user location.

Difficulty: Easy (1 point)

News API

Usage: Display latest tech news headlines to keep developers updated.

Difficulty: Easy (1 point)

Movie API

Usage: Provide curated movie suggestions for a relaxing break or to inspire creativity.

Difficulty: Easy (1 point)

Bonus: Optionally, you could integrate Twilio API to send SMS alerts (e.g., daily motivational texts or important updates) for extra points.

NPM Package Integration (At Least 10 Packages)
To maximize your score, mix easy, medium, and hard packages. Here’s one possible list with their corresponding difficulty points:

Easy Packages (1 point each):
Axios – For making HTTP requests to the external APIs.

Dotenv – To manage API keys and configuration via environment variables.

Nodemon – For auto-restarting your server during development.

Cors – To handle cross-origin requests.

Chalk – For colorful, enhanced logging in your CLI.

Lodash – For utility functions and data manipulation.

Date-fns – For formatting and parsing dates (e.g., contest dates).

React-spinners – For showing loading indicators on the frontend.

React-icons – To incorporate icons in your UI.

React-lazyload – To improve performance by lazy‑loading components.

Toastify – For easy-to-use toast notifications.

Medium Packages (3 points each):
Helmet – For setting secure HTTP headers in your Express app.

JWT (jsonwebtoken) – For secure authentication if you add user login features.

(Optional) Luxon – An alternative to Date-fns for handling more complex date/time needs.

Hard Package (5 points each):
TypeScript – Use TypeScript to enforce strong typing, improving code quality and maintainability.
(Alternatively, you could opt for a hard package like Express-brute for advanced security—but TypeScript not only improves your code but also showcases advanced development skills.)

Bonus for Underrated Packages:
quick-validate – A lightweight input validation library that may have fewer than 10k weekly downloads. Integrate it to validate user input (like search queries or form data) to earn additional bonus points.

Custom npm Package (Bonus):
dev-motivator – Develop your own npm package that returns a random motivational quote or coding tip when invoked. This custom package integration will demonstrate originality and yield bonus points.

How It Comes Together
Backend (Node.js/Express):

Set up an Express server using Axios to call each external API.

Use Dotenv to store your API keys securely.

Apply Cors and Helmet middleware for security.

If you add user authentication, protect routes with JWT.

Use Nodemon for a smooth development workflow.

Frontend (React):

Build a component‑based dashboard that displays:

Contest and rating data (Codeforces).

GitHub profile stats.

Local weather information.

News headlines.

Movie recommendations.

Daily motivational quote from your dev-motivator package.

Enhance UI interactivity with React-spinners, React-icons, React-lazyload, and Toastify.

Testing & Quality:

Write tests using Jest.

Use Lodash, Date-fns, and optionally Luxon for data formatting and manipulation.

Integrate quick-validate to ensure robust input validation.

Deployment & Bonus Considerations:

Deploy your project on a platform like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify.

Emphasize the custom motivational package and any underrated npm packages for bonus points.

If you develop your own API or npm package, document it well and highlight its uniqueness.

Summary
By developing the DevVibe Dashboard, you’ll use a minimum of 5 external APIs and integrate over 10 npm packages spanning easy, medium, and hard difficulties. This project not only meets the requirements but also stands out as a unique, useful tool for developers—rewarding extra points for originality, custom package development, and incorporating underrated libraries.
